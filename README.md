# Comp.-Sci.-Topics-Assignment-2
Develop a SIMPLE program (in Java OR Python) that meets the curriculum requirements above, such as a short tutorial with some interactive questions. In this type of program, an approximate expectation would be 2 to 4 sections of reviewing information given via text, pictures and/or videos followed by a few questions (3 to 5) to test a person’s understanding, for a grand total of about 10 to 12 questions. It does not HAVE to be this type of program. If you can find a way to put together a program in a different (creative) manner, that’s great, but just make sure you meet the curriculum requirements for the expectations outlined above, as that is your more important source of marks.(About 60% to 70% Environmental Stewardship content, about 30% to 40% programming)
